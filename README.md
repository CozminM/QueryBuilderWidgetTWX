# Advanced Query Builder widget
This is an advanced query builder allowing to build much more complex queries compared to the OOTB filter widget.
Supports complex conditions, deep nesting, AND/OR conditions and more.

It is based on the [jQuery QueryBuilder](https://querybuilder.js.org/) library.

## Usage
Similar to the filter widget, it expects a infotable with the datashape definiton. This can vary at runtime. 
The widget then generates a query expression.
